### Beta I Sprint Meetings
Regular text communication over discord, as well as 1 on 1 meetings on discord for pair programming. the all-group meetings were a little lacking, but not really to the detriment of our work. Discussed division of responsibilities and pair programming.

### Beta I Sprint Comments
Clicking on a book in the 'view multiple books' view gives you a 404 instead of bringing you to the associated 'view single book' view for that book. This will be fixed very soon. Also we ran into a Vercel issue when deploying. Something to do with yarn failing to build when it would modify yarn.lock. If memory serves, installing yarn with npm and then running yarn install fixed the error. It was pretty simple, even if my recollection is wrong. Other than that, no real issues or comments. I (Noah) suspect things will begin to make even more sense and fall into place on the frontend side beginning next week.
