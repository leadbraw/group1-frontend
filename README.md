### Beta I Sprint Meetings
Regular text communication over discord, as well as 1 on 1 meetings on discord for pair programming. the all-group meetings were a little lacking, but not really to the detriment of our work.

### Beta I Sprint Comments
Clicking on a book in the 'view multiple books' view gives you a 404 instead of bringing you to the associated 'view single book' view for that book. This will be fixed very soon. Other than that, no real issues or comments. I (Noah) suspect things will begin to make even more sense and fall into place on the frontend side beginning next week.
